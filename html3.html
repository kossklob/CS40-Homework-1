			The most adrhenaline inducing moment of a good <span style="color:gold">cliff jump</span> are the moments before you fully commit to jumping. Those agonizing times in your head when your brain is coming up with one hundred and one reasons to do anything but jump.

			I'm not sure if I would label myself as an adrhenaline junkie per-say, but I am certainly not an avid cliff jumper. Some of the local boys would hurl themselves off of the cliffs surrounding us, many of them much higher than what is pictured, and land with a silky smooth splash into the warm Hawaiian water. Crazy!

			It's a very interesting sport to think about from a spectator's point of view. How would a person attempt to monetize such an event? Running commericals inbetween jumps? That runs into the issue that I tackled earlier in this segment, the most exciting moment is the point just before the "send". How would you monetize an event?
